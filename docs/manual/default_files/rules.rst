Rules
-----

Rules are the deduction rules that allow, from a given set of true facts, the derivation of new ones. Each rule asks for a collection of arguments, demanded by its premise predicates, that has to be "matched". Next, the rule is "applied", at which point the corresponding predicate is added to the proof state.

As a standard, rules are labelled in order (r00 to r49), but some rules have more specific names, for readability. The naming shows in the proof step, as the reason a proof step is true.
