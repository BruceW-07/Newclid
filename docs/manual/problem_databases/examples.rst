========

This miscelaneous file of problems contains straightforward problems used to test the engine, test new features, check if the reasoner knows basic geometry facts and theorems, as well as larger problems that were used to see the engine's overall capabilities. It started with the first four problems (orthocenter, orthocenter_aux, incenter_excenter, euler), released as examples with the original AlphaGeometry codebase, and was expanded during the process of getting to know and enhancing the capabilities of the engine. Most of them are simple, striaghtforward problems, meant to check one very specific theorem, rule or behavior, and should run quickly, although that is not always the case.

A more detailed crackdown of the problems is shown in the table below.
